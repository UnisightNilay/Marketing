# Changelog Documentation Rule

## Requirements
Whenever changes are made to the codebase, you MUST document them with the following information:

### 1. Change Description
- Provide a detailed description of what was changed
- Include the purpose and reasoning behind the change
- List all files that were modified, created, or deleted
- Describe the impact of the changes on the system

### 2. Git Information
- **Git Branch**: Specify the branch where changes were made
- **Git Commit**: Include the commit hash/ID after committing changes
- If changes haven't been committed yet, note that they are pending commit

### 3. Documentation Format
Structure changelog entries as follows:

```
## [Date] - [Brief Title]

### Description
[Detailed description of changes]

### Files Changed
- `path/to/file1.ext` - [what was changed]
- `path/to/file2.ext` - [what was changed]

### Git Information
- **Branch**: [branch-name]
- **Commit**: [commit-hash]

### Impact
[Description of how this affects the system]
```

### 4. When to Document
- After implementing new features
- After fixing bugs
- After refactoring code
- After updating dependencies
- After configuration changes
- Any other significant code modifications

### 5. Location
- Document changes in `CHANGELOG.md` at the project root
- If `CHANGELOG.md` doesn't exist, create it
- Keep entries in reverse chronological order (newest first)
